# Recipe Search

## About the Project
This project uses [React](https://react.dev/), [semantic-ui](https://react.semantic-ui.com/), and the [Forkify](https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/) API to display a list of recipes based on a user search query. 

### Nav Bar
The navigation bar at the top of every page allows the user to redirect themselves to either the home page or recipe page. Pressing the logo is equivalent to the home page.

### Home Page
Basic landing page to introduce website to user.

### Recipes
The user can query recipes, however, only certain [terms](https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/phrases.html) will work due to the limitations of the API.

If the user queries a valid term, a list of recipe results will be displayed. For each recipe, the recipe title, publisher name, and image preview will be displayed, and there is the option to:
 - view the source page, or 
 - view the recipe details, which provides 
    - recipe title
    - publisher name
    - an image preview of the recipe
    - the recipe source page
    - publisher page
    - recipe ingredients
